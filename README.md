# Weather Prediction Model
Overview<br>
This repository contains a weather prediction model that forecasts weather conditions based on various factors such as precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind speed, and current weather patterns.<br>

Features<br>
**Prediction Algorithm:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast weather conditions.<br>
**Factor Inputs:** Accepts multiple factors including precipitation, max temperature, min temperature, wind speed, and current weather state to generate predictions.<br>
**Accuracy Improvement:** Continuously updated and trained to enhance accuracy based on new data and algorithm improvements.<br>
Installation<br>
To use this weather prediction model, follow these steps:<br>

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-prediction.git
cd weather-prediction
Install Dependencies:<br>

# Use the prediction for further analysis or display<br>
print(prediction)
Data
The model relies on historical weather data for training and validating the prediction accuracy. The dataset used for training and testing the model is not included in this repository due to its size. However, instructions on obtaining and formatting the dataset are provided in the WeatherReport-Dataset.csv file.
